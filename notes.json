        "  - A (asymptote): 94.3 mg/L = level where decay approaches zero",
        "  - B (displacement): -1.629 = curve shape",
        "  - C (decay rate): 0.01483 /day = rate of decay change over time",

        "• Post-Venetoclax Gompertz Parameters:",
        "  - A (asymptote): 9.7 mg/L = much lower asymptotic level",

        "  - C (decay rate): 0.01405 /day = similar decay rate change",

        "• Key Data Patterns:",
        "  - Both treatments show Gompertz kinetics (natural slowing over time)",
        "  - Pre-venetoclax trajectory heads toward 94.3 mg/L (partial response level)",
        "  - Post-venetoclax trajectory heads toward 9.7 mg/L (deep response level)",

        "  - Venetoclax therapy approaches CR-level asymptote",
        "  - Both show increasing resistance/slowing response over time - this is expected"
